 Designing PRG (Salsa20 Inspired)

A simple implementation and visualization of a **Pseudo Random Generator (PRG)** inspired by the Salsa20 stream cipher.

This project is created for learning purposes — to better understand:
- How PRGs work
- Basic cryptographic design ideas
- Visualizing randomness and algorithm behavior

# Features
- Implementation of a PRG inspired by Salsa20
- Randomness visualization charts
- Simple UI to test and experiment with outputs
- Clean and understandable code for students
